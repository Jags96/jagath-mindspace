      <description>&lt;p&gt;Summary : &amp;ldquo;Apartments Recommendation System based on user preferences with flexible search filters; Custom Flexibility Options; Feature Similarity recommendation&amp;rdquo;
Project : &lt;a href=&#34;https://datasciencegroup1.streamlit.app/score_based_top_apartments&#34;&gt;Group Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;major-features&#34;&gt;Major Features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexible Search Filters for Bathroom and Bedroom Count; My own design of flexibility [Custom]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key Word Search Filter [KeyWord]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher Dimensional Feature Similarity Recommendations [SVD]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;intentionmotivations&#34;&gt;Intention/Motivations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example user case scenario: If an user wants to filter an apartment in a state Texas, looking for 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms apartment in certain price range. In a simple content filter the user sets filters state to Texas and bedroom count to 3 and bathroom count to 3. But in reality the user might be little flexible with the bathroom count to be 2 as well. In such cases, the user has to choose bathroom count to 2 or 3. This is acceptable effort in case of slight flexibility with respect to bathroom. But in case of user with higher flexibility, lets say the user is ok with anywhere 2-5 bedrooms counts and any number of bathrooms. This will make user to specifically select all the acceptable counts for his/her rooms. Which is a lot of effort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if the user can simply specify an certain level of flexibility of their needs before hand, which will allow them to scroll over multiple options available without having to worry about them selecting each useful count.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on this idea/intentions, I have incorporated an score based filtering system, which works similar to how ranking system give ranking to top relevant results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

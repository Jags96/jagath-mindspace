Major Features

Flexible Search Filters for Bathroom and Bedroom Count; My own design of flexibility [Custom]
Key Word Search Filter [KeyWord]
Higher Dimensional Feature Similarity Recommendations [SVD]

Intention/Motivations

Example user case scenario: If an user wants to filter an apartment in a state Texas, looking for 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms apartment in certain price range. In a simple content filter the user sets filters state to Texas and bedroom count to 3 and bathroom count to 3. But in reality the user might be little flexible with the bathroom count to be 2 as well. In such cases, the user has to choose bathroom count to 2 or 3. This is acceptable effort in case of slight flexibility with respect to bathroom. But in case of user with higher flexibility, lets say the user is ok with anywhere 2-5 bedrooms counts and any number of bathrooms. This will make user to specifically select all the acceptable counts for his/her rooms. Which is a lot of effort.
What if the user can simply specify an certain level of flexibility of their needs before hand, which will allow them to scroll over multiple options available without having to worry about them selecting each useful count.
Based on this idea/intentions, I have incorporated an score based filtering system, which works similar to how ranking system give ranking to top relevant results.

Based on this idea/intentions, I have incorporated an score based filtering system, which works similar to how ranking system give ranking to top relevant results. Custom Score-Based Filtering Idea/Logic:\nScore rating is given out of 10; By default the ratings are set to 10, if the user want to adjust the flexibility rating, they can do so based on their requirements. Score is given to selected room counts, So if score is 10 that implies 0 flexibility which is nothing but restrict filtering. If score is set to 1 (the lowest possible) that implies maximum flexibility.\nNow based on the rating they choose between 1 to 10, the points for the chosen bathrooms count will be same as the score they choose. And the remaining points are redistributed to adjacent bathroom counts. Similarly for the bedrooms count and score. Based on the chosen state and city, the dataset is shortlisted, and now the scores are assigned to all the apartments in the subset. The total score of each apartment is a simple sum of the score obtained by each apartment. Now, based on the score the apartments are displayed Redistribution of flexibility-score Checkout of the Flexible search filter ",
